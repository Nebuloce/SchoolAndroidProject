# SchoolAndroidProject
Final Android project for school

This project takes some parts of Branko Cirovic's android examples (Made in Android Studio 1.1.0) and combines them into a full app with some added features and also brings it into the newer Android Studio 3.4.*.
Will be finishing the app by making the calendar section fully functioning (Can add events but not delete right now). Will also be tweaking some things and maybe also creating seperate xml files for other courses.
